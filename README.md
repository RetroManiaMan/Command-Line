# Command-Line
Hey guys, Krypto here, or should I say Syntex! Anyways, guys I'm here happy to say that I will now be creating Google Chrome Extensions! My first extension is like a mini terminal. It looks like MacOS's Spotlight but PACK with functionality. Command Line is literally a command terminal. Just type in any of the available commands like /open &lt;url>!
