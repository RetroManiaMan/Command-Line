# Command-Line
Hello everyone, Krypto here— or should I say Syntex! I’m excited to announce that I will be developing Google Chrome Extensions! My first project is a mini terminal that resembles MacOS's Spotlight but is packed with functionality. It's called Command Line, and you can simply type in various commands, like /open <youtube.com>, to get started!

Please note that the extension is still a work in progress, and it may take some time to complete.

Once it's finished, I can’t wait to see how you all use it! I’d love to hear your thoughts on Command Line and any upcoming Chrome extensions I'm developing—feel free to share your feedback in the issues section of this repository!

Thanks for all the support by following me guys! This means a lot to me!

Best regards,

System Technologies aka Syntex
