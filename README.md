# Command-Line
Hello everyone, I’m sad to say that I'm going to discontinue creating Google Chrome Extensions. My first extension, Command Line, didn't work out, so I paused on that one. Then I started on a new extension, also didn't work out. So, here I ask any developers (especially Chrome Extension devs) to please help me out! Please! All help will be greatly appreciated! Also, I can't really publish my extensions on Chrome because I need 5 bucks (5 dollars).

Just so you know, the extension is still a work in progress, and it may take some time to complete.

Once it's finished, I can’t wait to see how you all use it! I’d love to hear your thoughts on Command Line and any upcoming Chrome extensions I'm developing—feel free to share your feedback in the issues section of this repository!

**Screenshots!**

The screenshots here are from when Command Line was working. But it's not, anymore.
